# Davi Henrique's portfolio

Hello, my name is Davi Henrique. I have a phd in robotics. Currently (2021) im a post-doc researcher working with time series prediction using deep learning. You can check out my academic production [here](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_vNl6lAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Next, i present some of the projects i got involved over the years.


# [Project 1: Construction of an autonomous sailboat plaform N-boat](https://nboat-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)

This is a project that i've been working since 2013 when i was an undergrad. N-boat is a fully autonomous sailboat robot capable of performing long term offshore missions without human intervention. I developed most of the electronic system and the software of the sailboat (both navigation and control).

# Project 2: Sailboat navigation system

- Developed multiple controller strategies for the sail
- Created new strategy to sail upwind
- Added metrics for perfomance evaluation
- Implemented these feature in the Ardupilot framework
- Tested the system in SITL

# Project 3: Simulator for Water Surface Vehicles in ROS-Gazebo

- 

# Project 4: Forecast of COVID-19 time series using STACKED-LSTM

- Implemented
