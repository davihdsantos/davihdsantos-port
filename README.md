# Davi Henrique's portfolio

Hello, my name is Davi Henrique. I have a phd in robotics. Currently (2021) im a post-doc researcher working with time series prediction using deep learning. You can check my academic production [here](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_vNl6lAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Next, i present some of the projects i got involved over the years.


# [Project 1: Construction of an autonomous sailboat plaform N-boat](https://nboat-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)

This is a project that i've been working since 2013 when i was an undergrad. N-boat is a fully autonomous sailboat robot capable of performing long term offshore missions without human intervention. I participated in the developement of the electronic system and most of the software for the intelligence of the sailboat (both autonomous navigation and control).

# [Project 2: Sailboat navigation system](https://github.com/Natalnet/ardupilot/tree/nboat_develop)

- Developed multiple controller strategies for the sail
- Created new strategy to sail upwind
- Added metrics for perfomance evaluation
- Implemented these feature in the Ardupilot framework
- Tested the system in SITL

# [Project 3: Simulator for Water Surface Vehicles in ROS-Gazebo](https://github.com/disaster-robotics-proalertas/usv_sim_lsa)

- Simulator with multiple USV vehicles
- Realistic disturbances (wind and water current)
- Participated in the development of the platforms (models, dynamics) and their control system

# [Project 4: Simulator for a quadcopter competition using ROS-GAZEBO](https://github.com/Natalnet/cbr_petrobras)

Our robotic lab was going to participate in a competition in 2019 and the first step was to build this simulator to test the navigation system. Unfortunelly we didnt compete but i build this simulator.

# [Project 5: Forecast of COVID-19 time series using STACKED-LSTM](https://github.com/Natalnet/ncovid-air-paper)

- Predict infected and deaths number caused by COVID-19
- Use of deep learning techniques
- Developed the data pre-processing, training, evaluation and visualization
- Hyperparameter optimization of the network architecture
- Evaluation of multiple forecast models (generated with STACKED-LSTM)
